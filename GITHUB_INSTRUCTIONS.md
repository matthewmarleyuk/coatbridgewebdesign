# GitHub Deployment Instructions

Since this environment doesn't have Git installed, you'll need to follow these steps to deploy your project to GitHub:

## Method 1: Download and Push Locally

1. **Download your project**
   - Use the "Download" button in the StackBlitz interface to download a ZIP file of your project

2. **Create a GitHub repository**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "coatbridge-web-design")
   - Choose whether to make it public or private
   - Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push your project to GitHub**
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file on your local machine
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted folder
   - Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Method 2: GitHub Web Interface

1. **Download your project**
   - Use the "Download" button in the StackBlitz interface to download a ZIP file of your project

2. **Create a GitHub repository**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "coatbridge-web-design")
   - Choose whether to make it public or private
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Upload your files using the GitHub web interface**
   - In your new empty repository, click on "uploading an existing file" link
   - Extract the ZIP file on your local machine
   - Drag and drop the files to upload them to GitHub
   - Add a commit message and click "Commit changes"
   - You may need to repeat this process for multiple batches of files if there are many files

## Next Steps After Deployment

Once your files are on GitHub, you can:

1. Enable GitHub Pages for static site hosting
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - Select your main branch as the source
   - Click "Save"

2. Set up automatic deployment to Netlify or Vercel
   - Sign up for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository
   - Configure build settings (for this Next.js project):
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Deploy your site
